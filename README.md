Generic is a library for [Generic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming), also known as [Multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch).

The Generic library supports:

* multi-dispatch: like `functools.singledispatch`, but for more than one parameter
* multi-methods: multi-dispatch, but for methods
* event dispatching: based on a hierarchical event structure (event objects)

[documentation](http://generic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) hosted at
excellent readthedocs.org project. Development takes place on
